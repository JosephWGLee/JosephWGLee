- Hi, I'm Joseph, an early career scientist with a background in T Cell Receptor and Antibody Therapeutics who is currently learning bioinformatics with a specific interest in Machine Learning and its applications in this field. 
- This Github acts as a way for me to keep track of any projects I am working or collaborating on.
- My current project is focused on machine learning and the further development of a Gaussian Process regression method (GPcounts) for RNA-Seq.
