## 
- 🔭 I am a scientist with a background in wet-lab antibody and TCR therapeutics. My interests are in applying machine learning to accelarate structural biology and drug design.
  
- 🌱 Previous work includes optimising a Bayesian Machine Learning approach for modelling gene expression time series under the supervision of [Professor Magnus Rattray](https://research.manchester.ac.uk/en/persons/magnus.rattray/), and stress-testing machine-learning based predictive ligand binding in low-homology contexts under the supervision of [Professor Simon Lovell](https://research.manchester.ac.uk/en/persons/simon.lovell).
